## Folder structure
- events-app/ : The working Events Application for reference (shall be shared later)
- events-server/ : The backend for the Event Application. To run the backend server, navigate to the events-server folder in the terminal (Command prompt), install required Node modules, and start the server
```
$> cd path/to/events-server
$> npm install
$> npm start
```
Now view the APIs by opening ```http://localhost:8001/``` in a browser
- session-demos/ : Demos created by instructor during the training. The demos will be pushed from time-to-time. You can pull in the code, to get updates as and when instructor pushes them. __Please do not make ANY modifications here__. If you do, you will encounter merge conflicts when pulling in code during the training (feel free to modify it once the training is over).  
__Note__: You can create your own folder which parallels the folder structure within session-demos created by the instructor. This way, tracking your examples against the ones discussed in sessions will become easy.

## Additional backend (for practice)
- [Online Store Server](http://awesome-store-server.herokuapp.com/) - A backend having data for an online store (products, reviews). You can build a simple online store that displays list of products on a page. On clicking a product, user is navigated to a page displaying all of the details for the product. The reviews for the product may be shown below, along with a form to add a new review for the product. You may also have a page to add a new product.
